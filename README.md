# ui-exercise
Interview exercise


## Exercise 1
The images in the *proofs* folder show a UI component that requires building as a static prototype. The basic HTML has been started for you and some assets provided. 
Please take into account these points when building it:						 					

- Note the different layout at mobile screen sizes. 	
- The search form doesn't need to do anything yet.			
- The behaviour of the tabs can be coded with javascript or pure CSS.	


## Exercise 2
The prototype you have been provided with has some errors in the javascript, so that it is no longer working. The expected behaviour is:			
- If you select assets individually then they should go green and the '0 selected' count should increment.		
- The bulk select button should toggle the selection state of all assets on the page. 

Please try and get the prototype working, keeping a note of fixes you have made.
